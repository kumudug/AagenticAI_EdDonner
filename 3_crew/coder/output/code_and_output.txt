The Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ..., multiplied by 4, is as follows:

```python
sum_result = 0.0
for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)
    if i % 2 == 1:
        term *= -1
    sum_result += term
result = sum_result * 4
print(f"The result after 10,000 terms multiplied by 4 is: {result}")
```

The output of the code is:
```
The result after 10,000 terms multiplied by 4 is: 3.1414926535900345
```
